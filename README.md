# ChromeExtention-Notepad
This was one of my first project after I just learnt basic web dev (html, css and js).  It a very simple notepad you can you in chrome.
It overlays on your current tab. The text is saved using local storage and is saved even after closing the browser it will still be there
I havent published it on chrome store. However to use it simply download all the files in a folder. Next go to chrome browser  enter this: chrome://extensions/ turn on developer mode toggle button on the top right. Then click on "load unpacked" button and select the folder from there you can now use the extentions.
